Welcome! 

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [National Student Support Accelerator](https://studentsupportaccelerator.org/) at [Stanford University](https://ed.stanford.edu/).

My research focuses on examining the causal effects of K-12 education policies on adolescents' educational and health outcomes using experimental and quasi-experimental methods. I am also interested in uncovering informative patterns and trends using descriptive methods and demographic techniques.

As a researcher, my goal is to provide rigorous empirical evidence on how policies impact various aspects of human development, such as citizenship and health behaviors, allowing policymakers to make decisions based on a more comprehensive and evidence-based understanding of education. 

I received my PhD in Education Policy with a dual-title in Comparative and International Education and a minor in Demography from [Pennsylvania State University](https://ed.psu.edu/academics/departments/department-education-policy-studies). I earned a BA and MA in Ethics Education from [Seoul National University](https://edu.snu.ac.kr/en/) in South Korea. In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching tennis, bouldering, and exploring coffee shops.
