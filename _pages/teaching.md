During my PhD at Penn State, I was a graduate teaching assistant for the undergraduate course **EDTHP 115 - Education in American Society** in Spring and Summer 2024. This course examines the historical, political, philosophical, and sociological influences that have shaped education in the United States. Throughout the semester, students critically analyze a range of educational policies, practices, and reforms, deepening their understanding of American schooling while honing their skills in evidence-based teaching and policy development.

Before starting my PhD, I was a middle school Ethics teacher, a core subject in social studies, and a graduate teaching assistant during my MA studies in South Korea.
